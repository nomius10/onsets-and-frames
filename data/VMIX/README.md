# where are these files from?

These audio files were picked from MusicNet and Bach10.

Only songs containing violins were taken from MusicNet, and were split into two categories: ones that contain violin-class instruments plus piano, and ones that contain only violin-class instruments. Unfortunately for my uses, none of the audio files contain solely violin, but rather a combination of violin, viola, cello and double bass. I chose to relabel them all as just "violin".

MusicNet songs have corresponding MIDI files, generated from the labels.
